This project presents an intelligent web-based tool for classifying breast cancer subtypes based on multiomics data using advanced optimization algorithms. The core objective is to enhance classification performance through Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA)-based feature selection, and compare its performance against Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) using Random Forest and SVM classifiers.
